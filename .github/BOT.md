# Moistello Bot Setup & Usage

The bot runs as **GitHub Actions workflows** inside this repo and is named **moistello**. It handles:

| What | Workflow | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| Lint + test + build gate | `ci.yml` | every PR / push |
| **Auto-merge** 30 min after CI is green | `moistello: Auto-Merge` | CI success (30m delay), `/merge` comment |
| **Auto-fix** conflicts + failing CI | `moistello: Auto-Fix` | PR conflict, CI failure (PR *and* `main`) |

The bot **never assigns issues or reviewers** — that stays manual (you decide who implements what).

---

## Free-tier note (your concern)

- Both `moistello-*` repos are **public** → GitHub Actions minutes are **unlimited** (no charge).
- **Auto-merge** is a native GitHub feature available on the free plan for public repos.
- All workflows are **webhook-driven** (no polling), so they don't hit REST API rate limits.
- The only cost, if you want it, is the **LLM API key** used by the AI auto-fix step
  (you can leave it unset and the bot will still rebase + auto-merge, just not AI-fix).

## Secrets to configure (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)

| Secret | Required? | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `OPENCODE_API_KEY` | No* | Enables AI auto-fix of failing CI. Skip → bot rebases/merges only. |
| `OPENCODE_MODEL` | No | Override model (default `opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash`, the cheapest capable coding model). |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | No | A PAT with `repo` scope; enables pushing to protected branches. Falls back to the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. |

\* Only set `OPENCODE_API_KEY` if you want the bot to actually edit code to fix CI. Without it, CI failures are flagged for a human (you) to fix — which guarantees a human implements the work.

## Recommended branch protection (to make auto-merge safe)

1. Repo → Settings → Branches → Add rule → default branch.
2. Require: `status checks to pass before merging` → select **CI** checks.
3. Optionally require 1 approving review if you want a human gate before the bot merges
   (set `require_human_review: true` in `.github/bot-config.yml` to match).

With auto-merge, the **moistello** bot merges a linked PR **30 minutes after CI passes** (set `delay_minutes` in `.github/bot-config.yml`). If branch protection requires a human review, the bot waits for that review before the 30-minute countdown completes.

## Auto-fix behavior

The **moistello** bot auto-fixes two things, both gated behind `OPENCODE_API_KEY`
(so it only acts when you've enabled AI fixing):

1. **Merge conflicts** — on a PR with conflicts it first tries a clean rebase; if that's
   impossible it hands the conflicted repo (full codebase, all history) to an opencode agent
   that resolves the conflict correctly, completes the rebase, and pushes.
2. **Failing CI** — if CI fails (tests/lint/build) on a PR or on `main`, an opencode agent
   checks out the full repository, reproduces the failure, fixes the root cause, verifies
   tests pass, and pushes the fix. This lets the bot keep your repos green even when you're
   not available.

It NEVER assigns issues or reviewers — that stays manual.

The workflow checks out the **entire repository with full history** (not just the PR head)
so the agent has complete codebase context, and caches Go modules / npm + the opencode CLI
between runs to avoid re-downloads and cut cost.

### Off-peak waiting (cost saver)

DeepSeek V4 switches to **peak/off-peak pricing** (peak = 2.4–4.7x the off-peak rate):
- **Peak hours:** 01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00 UTC
- **Off-peak hours:** the other 17 hours/day at the cheapest rate

When a merge conflict needs AI resolution during a **peak hour**, the moistello bot
**waits until the next off-peak hour starts**, then runs opencode at the cheaper rate.
Toggle this with `wait_for_off_peak` in `.github/bot-config.yml`.

## Manual merge command

Anyone with write access can comment `/merge` on a PR to enable auto-merge.

## Ignore rules

PRs whose title contains `[wip]`, `[do not merge]`, or `draft` are never auto-merged.
